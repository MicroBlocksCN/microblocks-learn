Start with an **attach LED NeoPixel strip to pin** block.  Input both the number of NeoPixels on your strip and the pin to which the strip is connected. Attach a **set NeoPixels** block to your script and click on it. Your NeoPixels should light up!

To make it look like the rainbow is moving, rotate the NeoPixels by one forever after the program has started.
