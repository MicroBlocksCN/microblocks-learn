### Introduction

This advanced activity uses the microphone, speaker, and radio of the micro:bit v2 to make a simple walkie-talkie. It works by recording a short message then transmitting it as a sequence of radio packets to any micro:bits within radio range (10-15 meters).

This activity builds on the digital sound recording and playback ideas from the "Recording Sound with the micro:bit v2" activity.
