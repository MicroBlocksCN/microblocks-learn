### Set Up MicroBlocks

Visit [microblocks.fun/download](https://microblocks.fun/download) to download MicroBlocks (free!) or [run](https://microblocks.fun/run/microblocks.html) in a Chrome or Edge browser without installing anything.

Connect the micro:bit to a computer with a USB cable. Make sure it is not a *power-only* cable.
