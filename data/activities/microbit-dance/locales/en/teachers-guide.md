# Introduction

In this activity, students will be able to make a micro:bit creature that moves
and dances out of a few simple parts: a micro:bit, the box it comes in (or
something similar), rubber bands, servos, wheels, and a popsicle stick.
Students will also explore the power of remote control to move their projects
in creative ways.

# Goal

Students will create a dancing micro:bit by affixing two continuous rotation
servos with wheels to a box. Students will write scripts to control their
project by adjusting the speed and direction of the servos and wheels. 

# Materials needed

* micro:bit with battery pack and extension board (such as the ring:bit or basic:bit)
* 2 continuous rotation servos
* 2 wheels
* Small box (like the one many micro:bits come in)
* At least 4 rubber bands (#64, 3-1/2 x Â¼ work well) 
* Small popsicle stick
* Tape

# Procedure

### Introduction

* This activity connects to many curriculum standards. Students may make
 connections to simple machines, discussing wheels and axles. There is also an
 opportunity to connect to physics concepts around motion. 
* One way to introduce this activity and gather background knowledge is to show
 students the materials they will use (or project the image above) and ask them
 what they think they might make. 
* Explain to students that these components will allow them to make their
 creation move in all sorts of directions - wiggle from side to side, turn in
 place, or move forward and backward. 
* It might be fun to brainstorm simple dances that students imagine their
 micro:bits performing!

## Getting Set Up

The first step in assembling this project is connecting the servos to your
micro:bit. Here, we are using a ring:bit. Connect the servos so that the dark
wire (black or brown) is connected to the "G" or ground on the ring:bit. If you
are not using an extension board with its own batteries, you will need to attach
a battery to your micro:bit. The micro:bit cannot power the servos using only
power from the USB cable.

Next, using a rubber band, attach one servo to the box as you see in the picture
below. Then, carefully slide the other servo under the rubber band on the
opposite side.

Attach an additional rubber band for support. 

![Using an additional rubber band to tie the servos](../setup-03.png)

To mount your micro:bit on the box, attach a rubber band around the box
widthwise. 

![Securing the board with a rubber band](../setup-04.png)

[[note]]
You may want to remind students to be gentle with the servo connections.

The final rubberband helps hold the micro:bit more securely on top of the box.
Stretch the rubber band along the box lengthwise.

Next, affix the wheels to the servos. The screws that come with the servos can
be used to secure the wheels if they fall off too easily.

![Afficing the wheels to the servos](../setup-06.png)

Finally, attach the popsicle stick to the end of the micro:bit so that it is
opposite the wheels. This helps the box slide easily on hard surfaces, enabling
the servos and wheels to pull the weight of the box as it dances!

## Make it Move

Now that the box is assembled, students will want to make it move! Connect to
MicroBlocks by attaching the USB cable to the micro:bit.

[[note]]
Make sure that the extension board you are using is turned on. It is helpful to
use a long USB cable for this connection. Alternatively, students can also code
the micro:bit before the project is assembled. Students could connect the servos
and wheels to the micro:bit to test the movement then make adjustments once the
project is put together. 
[[/note]]

[[safety]]
For the next few pieces of code, it is helpful to instruct students to hold
their box off a surface so they can see the rotation of the wheels. This will
prevent the USB cable from becoming taut and possibly damaging the project or
computer. 
[[/safety]]

First, drag two set servo blocks into the scripting area. Encourage students to
experiment with different numbers. What happens when they set two positive
numbers? What about two negative numbers? By setting two positive numbers, the
box should turn in one direction. Two negative numbers and the box should turn
in the other direction. One positive and one negative will make the box move
forward or backward.

![Setting servo 1 to speed 30](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20setServoSpeed%201%2030;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[%22Servo%22])
![Setting servo 2 to speed -30](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20setServoSpeed%202%20-30;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[%22Servo%22])

Once students have made the box move, they may want to make it stop and get
ready for another dance move. We can use the *stop servo* block for that:

![Stopping servo 1](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20stopServo%201;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[%22Servo%22])
![Stopping servo 2](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20stopServo%202;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[%22Servo%22])

Put these scripts together with a wait block in between. When the program is
started, the box will move forward and stop.

![Moving forward for a bit, then stopping](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20whenStarted;%20setServoSpeed%201%2030;%20setServoSpeed%202%20-30;%20waitMillis%20500;stopServo%201;stopServo%202;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[%22Servo%22])

This is a great opportunity to show students how to make their own block in
MicroBlocks! This code can be made into a block labeled *forward*. Click on the
*My Blocks* category, add a command block, and name it forward. Next, move all
the scripts previously under when started to define the forward block. Drag
the new forward block into the scripting area to use this new command. Encourage
students to make different command blocks to make their projects move and dance.

## Setting Up a Remote Control

Once the project is moving the way students would like, they may want to control
it from afar. Students can write a code to use another micro:bit to control the
micro:bit on the box. This will make their project hands free! This process
introduces the concepts of remote control using radio blocks. Follow the steps
below to set up a remote control. 

First, while the micro:bit on the box is still connected, add a radio set group
block to its code under the when started block. Choose a number between 0 and
255 and remember it! 

![Setting the radio group to 8](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20whenStarted;%20%27%5Bradio:setGroup%5D%27%208;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[%22Servo%22%2C%22Radio%22])

Next, add a *when radio message received* block and tell the box what to do when
it receives the message. 

![When radio message received, move forward](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20whenCondition%20%28%27%5Bradio:messageReceived%5D%27%29;%20forward;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[%22Radio%22])

[[note]]
If you are working in a classroom with several micro:bits, you will want
students to choose different channels so as not to interfere with each other's
projects. Make a list on the board so everyone knows what numbers are in use.
[[/note]]

Save your current MicroBlocks project and open a new one. This is the one that
will program your second micro:bit, which 
will act as a remote control. Disconnect the micro:bit on the box
and connect your remote control micro:bit to your computer. Add these two
instructions for the remote control. 

![Setting the radio group to 8](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20whenStarted;%20%27%5Bradio:setGroup%5D%27%208;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[22Radio%22])

![MicroBlocks script](https://microblocks.fun/render?script=%22script%2010%2010%20%7B%20whenButtonPressed%20%27A%27;%20%27%5Bradio:sendInteger%5D%27%20123;%7D%20%22&scale=1.25&locale=English&libs=[%22Radio%22])

First, set the group to be the same as the micro:bit on your box. Next when
button A is pressed, use the *radio send number* block to send the command to
the micro:bit on the box. Any number will do, as we are just checking whether a
message has been received without looking at its contents. Unplug the remote
control micro:bit from the computer (make sure it has a battery pack attached)
and control your project!
